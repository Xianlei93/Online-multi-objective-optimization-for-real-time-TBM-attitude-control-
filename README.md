Coding script for the manuscript "Online multi-objective optimization for real-time TBM attitude control with spatio-temporal deep learning model".

******************************************************************************************************************************************************
"TBM position model training" performs data pre-processing and model trainig for GCN-LSTM networks. 
"TBM position optimization_geatpy" performs multi-objective optimization with online updating. The processing time for optimization is also evaluated. 
"Comparison with other methods" compares the model estimation results with other state-of-the-art methods, including BPNN, PCA-GRU and LSTM. 
"Optimization without update_woup" compares the optimization results with the MOO method that without online updating.
